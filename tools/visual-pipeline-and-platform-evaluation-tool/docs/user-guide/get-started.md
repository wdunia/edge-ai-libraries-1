# Get Started

The **Visual Pipeline and Platform Evaluation Tool** helps hardware decision-makers and software developers
select the optimal Intel® platform by adjusting workload parameters and analyzing performance metrics.
Through an intuitive web-based interface, the Smart NVR pipeline can be executed and key metrics such as
throughput and CPU/GPU utilization can be evaluated to assess platform performance and determine appropriate
system sizing.

By following this guide, the following tasks can be completed:

- **Set up the sample application**: Use the Docker Compose tool to quickly deploy the application in a target environment.
- **Run a predefined pipeline**: Execute the Smart NVR pipeline and observe metrics.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following:

- **System requirements**: The system meets the [minimum requirements](./get-started/system-requirements.md).
- **Docker platform**: Docker is installed. For details, see the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- **Dependencies installed**:
  - **Git**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
  - **Make**: Standard build tool, typically provided by the `build-essential` (or equivalent) package on Linux.
  - **curl**: Command-line tool for transferring data with URLs, typically provided by the `curl` package on Linux.

For GPU and/or NPU usage, appropriate drivers must be installed. The recommended method is to use the DLS installation
script, which detects available devices and installs the required drivers. Follow the **Prerequisites** section in
[Install Guide Ubuntu – Prerequisites](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/dlstreamer/blob/main/docs/user-guide/get_started/install/install_guide_ubuntu.md#prerequisites)

This guide assumes basic familiarity with Git commands and terminal usage. For more information, see
[Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc).

## Setup

Follow the steps below to quickly set up the environment and start
the Visual Pipeline and Platform Evaluation Tool.
For alternative ways to set up the sample application, refer to
[How to Build from Source](./get-started/build-from-source.md)

1. **Set up the working directory**:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool/onvif_discovery
   mkdir -p visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool/shared/models
   mkdir -p visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool/shared/videos
   mkdir -p visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool/shared/onvif
   cd visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool
   ```

2. **Download all required files**:

   ```bash
   curl -LO "https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/raw/refs/heads/main/tools/visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool/setup_env.sh"
   curl -LO "https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/raw/refs/heads/main/tools/visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool/compose.yml"
   curl -LO "https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/raw/refs/heads/main/tools/visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool/compose.cpu.yml"
   curl -LO "https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/raw/refs/heads/main/tools/visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool/compose.gpu.yml"
   curl -LO "https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/raw/refs/heads/main/tools/visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool/compose.npu.yml"
   curl -LO "https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/raw/refs/heads/main/tools/visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool/Makefile"
   curl -Lo onvif_discovery/Dockerfile "https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/raw/refs/heads/main/tools/visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool/onvif_discovery/Dockerfile"
   curl -Lo onvif_discovery/onvif_discovery_agent.py "https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/raw/refs/heads/main/tools/visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool/onvif_discovery/onvif_discovery_agent.py"
   curl -Lo shared/videos/default_recordings.yaml "https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/raw/refs/heads/main/tools/visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool/shared/videos/default_recordings.yaml"
   curl -Lo shared/models/supported_models.yaml "https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/raw/refs/heads/main/tools/visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool/shared/models/supported_models.yaml"
   chmod +x setup_env.sh
   ```

3. **Start the application**:

   ```bash
   make build-onvif-discovery run
   ```

4. **Verify that the application is running**:

   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

5. **Access the application**:

   - Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost` (or `http://<HOST-IP>`) to access
     the Visual Pipeline and Platform Evaluation Tool.

6. **Access the application API documentation**:

   - Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost/api/v1/docs` (or `http://<HOST-IP>/api/v1/docs`)
     to access the Swagger UI.

## Validation

**Verify build success**:
Check the logs and look for confirmation messages indicating that the microservice has started successfully.

### Model Installation and Management

AI models are installed on demand through the **Models** page in the web UI
(or directly via the `/api/v1/models` API endpoints). The backend proxies
install requests to the `model-download` microservice, which downloads and
converts the selected models into the shared `shared/models/output/`
volume. There is no separate installer container to run before starting
the application.

### Video Generation

The Visual Pipeline and Platform Evaluation Tool enables you to create
composite videos from multiple images stored in subdirectories. For more details, refer to
[the guide](./how-to-guides/use-video-generator.md).
